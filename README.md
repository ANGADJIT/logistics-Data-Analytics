# Freight Logistics Analytics Project

This analytics project revolves around cleansing logistics data, deriving meaningful insights, and visualizing key findings. The analysis is performed using Python within Jupyter Notebooks. The project structure includes two main files, namely `data-cleansing.ipynb` and `logistics-analytics.ipynb`, both located in the `src/analytics` folder.

## Data Cleansing (data-cleansing.ipynb)

The data cleansing phase focuses on several key points:

1. **Remove Missing Values:** Eliminate incomplete data points.
2. **Check Inconsistencies:** Ensure data consistency and coherence.
3. **Check Accuracy:** Validate the accuracy of information.
4. **Handle Outliers:** Manage and address outliers in the dataset.
5. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset for patterns and trends.
6. **Clean and Validate Data:** Ensure data integrity and correctness.
7. **Create Cleaned Data Asset:** Generate a cleaned dataset.

The cleaned data is then saved using a partitioning approach based on the year and quarter.

## Analytics (logistics-analytics.ipynb)

On the analytics side, the focus extends to the following areas:

1. **Descriptive Analysis:** Provide descriptive statistics and summaries.
2. **Operational Insight:** Extract insights to optimize logistics operations.
3. **Visualization and Reporting:** Utilize graphs and charts for effective communication.
4. **Predictive Analysis (Not Implemented yet):** Future expansion for predictive modeling.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project:

1. Create a virtual Python environment.
2. Install project dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `src/analytics` folder.
