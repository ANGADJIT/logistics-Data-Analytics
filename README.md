# Freight Logistics Analytics Project

This analytics project is centered around the cleansing of logistics data, deriving meaningful insights, and visualizing key findings using Python within Jupyter Notebooks. The project structure consists of two main files: `data-cleansing.ipynb` and `logistics-analytics.ipynb`, both located in the `src/analytics` folder.

## Data Cleansing (`data-cleansing.ipynb`)

The data cleansing phase focuses on enhancing data quality through the following key steps:

1. **Remove Missing Values:** Eliminate incomplete data points.
2. **Check Inconsistencies:** Ensure data consistency and coherence.
3. **Check Accuracy:** Validate the accuracy of information.
4. **Handle Outliers:** Manage and address outliers in the dataset.
5. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset for patterns and trends.
6. **Clean and Validate Data:** Ensure data integrity and correctness.
7. **Create Cleaned Data Asset:** Generate a cleaned dataset.

The cleaned data is then saved using a partitioning approach based on the year and quarter.

## Analytics (`logistics-analytics.ipynb`)

On the analytics side, the focus extends to the following areas:

1. **Descriptive Analysis:** Provide descriptive statistics and summaries.
2. **Operational Insight:** Extract insights to optimize logistics operations.
3. **Visualization and Reporting:** Utilize graphs and charts for effective communication.
4. **Predictive Analysis (Not Implemented Yet):** Placeholder for future expansion into predictive modeling.

### Predictive Analytics Not Applicable
The predictive analytics section is marked as not applicable due to insufficient data to answer predictive queries.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project:

1. Create a virtual Python environment.
2. Install project dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `src/analytics` folder.
